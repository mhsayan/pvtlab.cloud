          <p>
            Hi! I'm <strong>Mahmudul Hasan Sayan</strong>, a Software Engineer
            based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I specialize in building scalable web
            applications using .NET technologies and cloud-native architectures.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a Master's degree in Computer Science and over 3 years of
            professional experience, I work on enterprise solutions involving
            microservices, containerization, and DevOps practices. I'm
            passionate about clean code, performance optimization, and
            continuous learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my digital space where I share my thoughts on software
            development, architecture patterns, and things I learn along the
            way. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies
            or contributing to the developer community.
